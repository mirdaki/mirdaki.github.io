# Blog Theme 

The theme and set up for my personal blog [Code Captured](https://codecaptured.com). It is setup to have two separate blog feeds. One for a generic blog, and another for a photography one. Though that could be easily changed. 

To see the default site check out [mirdaki.github.io](https://mirdaki.github.io). 

## Built With

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) a simple, blog-aware, static site generator that let's you use Markdown to write your posts. 
- Theme is based off the Lanyon theme, with small changes. See [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md) for details. 
- It uses [Jekyll Paginate V2](https://github.com/sverrirs/jekyll-paginate-v2) for more versatile pagination than the original jekyll version

## Logo 

The logo here is just a placeholder I made quickly. I suggest using this [favicon generator site](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) to turn your sites logo into a favicon/app icon for every platform.
